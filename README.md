## General info
This is a Telegram bot written in Python based [python-telegram-bot library](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot). 
I've been able to complete this project, which is my first programming project as an autodidact, thanks to the help of many friends of mine, in particular thanks to:
* [@KaikyuLotus](https://github.com/KaikyuLotus/kitsu-maker-bot/blob/master/Utils/Logger.py) for inspiring me to work on this project with a script he made available to the public long time ago and for allowing me to use his beautiful and useful logger
* [@Aiku1](https://github.com/Aiku1) for helping me through many debugging phases and suggesting me always the right thing
* [@Goderesky](https://github.com/Goderesky), [@CrisMystik](https://github.com/CrisMystik), [@VonHeike](https://github.com/VonHeike) and many more for their support
